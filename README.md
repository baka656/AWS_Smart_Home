AWS Smart Home is a new fully managed "smart breaker panel" service that integrates with live pricing data to help homeowners optimize electrical consumption, reduce costs, and ease grid burden by running appliances at off-peak times, while providing users control through a smartphone app or web browser. The system utilizes a web app developed with Angular for the front-end, AWS Cognito for data security and authentication, S3 for data storage, IoT Core for communicating with IoT devices, and AWS Amplify for deployment, creating a comprehensive and secure smart home energy management solution.
